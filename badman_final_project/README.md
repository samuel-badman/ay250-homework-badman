# AY250 Final Project

### Sam Badman - 04/28/18

__Simulating the Drag Force and Torque using ray tracing__

The functions which contain the computation of the project are located in 
> ray_tracer.py

Each function is documented with a PEP257 compliant docstring

The explanation and visualization of the project are given in 
> astro250\_final\_proj.ipynb

A screen cap going through the project notebook and code is available on 
[dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0oi20g5t4x1l429/AADFJFcPBR6ZbO_NHV5fB6Gma?dl=0)
This should be able to be watched online rather than you downloading it.

.pkl files are included to load in the jupyter notebook in place of computations
that take a long time. The result is that anyone should be able to run the entire 
notebook very quickly.
