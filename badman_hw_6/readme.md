### Homework 6 - Supervised Machine Learning - Sam Badman

I have checked this homework in as a jupyter notebook. It is structured as :

* Cell for the grader to input the validation dataset pathname 
* Definition of methods to extract features from image files
* Function to extract all features from a given input image
* Instantiation and evaluation of the random forest classifier using a 10% test
 dataset. Methods to evaluate are : 
 (1) raw percentage of correct identifications
 (2) confusion matrix
 (3) feature importance
* Instantiation of classifier using 100% of the training data, and a function to
call and predict the features for a validation dataset with the pathname 
provided at the top of the notebook, assuming .jpg files only .
